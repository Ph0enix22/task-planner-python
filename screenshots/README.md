# Task Planner

---

## ✨ Features

- Add tasks with title, due date and priority
- View all tasks / pending / completed
- Mark tasks as done
- Delete tasks with confirmation
- Search tasks by keyword
- Statistics with completion rate

---

## Future Implementations

- **Timestamps** — Record exact time of task creation and completion
- **Smart Task Suggester** — Using the `os` and `time` modules, suggest which task to do next based on:
  - Time remaining before due date
  - Priority level
  - Difficulty / estimated effort to complete
- **Completion Probability** — Rate how likely a task is to be completed based on the above factors, helping the user focus on what's actually achievable next
- **File Saving** — Persist tasks between sessions so data isn't lost when the program closes
